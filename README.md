# Unique URIs for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)

This repository describes a method to describe NFTs through unique URIs.

It is structured in the following way:
- [urn-nft.md] defines the main `urn:nft` syntax
- Method-specific documents describe how NFTs should be identified for each well-known NFT framework, e.g. ERC-721.
