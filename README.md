# Unique URIs for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)

## What is it?

This repository describes a method to refer to NFTs through globally unique URIs, based on [RFC 8141: Uniform Resource Names (URNs)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8141).

It is structured in the following way:
- [urn-nft.md](urn-nft.md) defines the main `urn:nft` syntax
- Method-specific documents describe how NFTs should be identified for each well-known NFT framework, e.g. ERC-721.

## Known NFT methods

See the [urn:nft] specification for a registry of known methods. You can request to list a method by submitting a pull request.
